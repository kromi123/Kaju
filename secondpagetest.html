                <h1 class = "articlehead_2"><strong>What is SXSG All About?</strong></h1>
                <p class = "articlephar_2">“Sonic x Shadow Generations” (2024) is an upcoming DLC add-on that will be bundled with an all-new remastered version of the already released “Sonic Generations” (2011). This DLC will include a new gameplay story mode including the fan-favorite character Shadow the Hedgehog as it’s protagonist. The game will feature a whole array of levels for Shadow to traverse through, and ultimately stop the re-emerged Black Doom from causing havoc, while Sonic is busy trying to save time and space by defeating the Time-Eater. The game is slated for an October release, with pre-orders available for purchase right now.</p>
                <h1 class = "articlehead_2"><strong>What Will Be Included?</strong></h1>
                <p class = "articlephar_2">To get into the details and speculation of the content this DLC will offer. Just like the original base game back in 2011, this DLC’s levels for Shadow will consist of levels from past Sonic games in which Shadow (for the most part) featured in in some capacity. These levels range from the Space Colony Ark from “Sonic Adventure 2” on the Dreamcast (2001) to Rail Canyon from “Sonic Heroes” (2003). Interestingly Enough, in one of the gameplay trailers titled “Doom Powers Trailer” released for the game’s promotion on the official Sonic the Hedgehog social media accounts from a while back, it was revealed that games as recent as “Sonic Frontiers” (2022) would be getting representation, as “Chaos Island,” one of the 5 open-world zones from that game was confirmed to be a full-length stage for Shadow. It looks like not every stage will be from a game that Shadow was in, this raises some questions as to how this could possibly connect to the overall story of the game. Especially since this game might be happening simultaneously with the base game, and Sonic Frontiers takes place after Sonic Generations.</p>
                <h1 class = "articlehead_2"><strong>What Can We Expect From The Gameplay?</strong></h1>
                <p class = "articlephar_2">Speaking of Sonic Frontiers, this new addition is not only just adding new levels, but a whole new set of abilities as well as a full open zone for Shadow to navigate through. Now, the extent of how big the open world will be is unknown. Personally, I don’t expect a world as big as the ones from Frontiers. It is however, looking to evolve on the newly found game formula that debuted with that game. As Takashi Iizuka in an interview leading up to the release of Sonic Frontiers, described Frontiers as a “third evolution” for the franchise. It looks like this DLC will be the first to truly push forward the new gameplay foundations that the last mainline game started. In addition, the control of Shadow is also looking to be slightly different from that of Sonic’s in the base game, as it is going off of the modified Hedgehog Engine 2 that was used in Frontiers. So, it also can be stated that the overall movement and controls could be different, and even improvements on things such as improved momentum-based controls are to be anticipated, especially since previews such as the Summer Game Fest demo have shown instances of momentum being utilized in the boost-gameplay, such as ramps being seen in Kingdom Valley, and in The Ark.</p>
                <p class = "articlephar_2">Shadow also has a set of abilities that include using his Black-Doom DNA. These new abelites give Shadow different symbiote abilities, such as a squid form, a form that allows Shadow to surf, and even a form that gives shadow wings to fly. This gives the player a new set of potential pathways to take in different stages, as well as a way to add new gimmicks to the Sonic gameplay-formula, without hindering or damaging the core gameplay, rather expanding upon it in creative ways.</p>
                <h1 class = "articlehead_2"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1>
                <p class = "articlephar_2">Sonic x Shadow Generations is slated for release in October of 2024. From the looks of the game, to the first impressions shown, as well as the unanimous praise that it is getting from the overall community. This game definitely is looking to be an addition to the already expanding upward Sonic spiral.</p>
